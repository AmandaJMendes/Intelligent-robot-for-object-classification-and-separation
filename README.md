Abstract:
This project proposes the construction of a robotic system aiming object recognition, classification and separation using computer vision. The system’s components consist of a delimted surface, where the objects are going to be placed, a camera to capture the images, which are going to be processed by the computer vision and machine learning algorithms, stepper motors, to move the robot’s joints, and a simulation of the manipulator’s kinematic chain, since it wasn’t possible to bluid its mechanical structure. This project explores the intersection of robotics aspects such as kinematic operations, trajectory generation and motor controlling, and artificial intelligence techniques, such as the use of machine learning in computer vision. The implemented system can be used for didatic purposes as well as for research on methods for object recognition, classification and separation.
